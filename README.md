Pathological Retinal Alterations in Diabetes

Description
This repository contains the code, data, and resources for the project titled "Pathological Retinal Alterations in Diabetes". The project aims to study, identify, and analyze retinal alterations caused by diabetes using advanced computational techniques, including image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. It focuses on automating the detection of diabetic retinopathy and its progression stages to aid early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.
